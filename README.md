Utilizing the functionality of React + Vite, this application is able to fetch song data from the Freesound API and display it in search-engine format. It allows a user to search songs based on their input, view a list of songs, and view the data that comes along with them. A playlist is also available to the user if they choose to add songs to it, and multiple fields display song data and details.

All information on the Freesound API is included in their [Documentation](https://freesound.org/docs/api/).

Main features include:
- Searchability of user input
- A results list displaying all songs related to the user's search
- A data field displaying the following data on each song within the results list:

  1. Song name
  2. Author/Creater
  3. Description
  4. Tags
  5. Creation date
  6. Download count
  7. Average rating
  8. Waveform
 
- UI functionality for the user includes:

  1. A button to add a song to a playlist
  2. A button to play the selected song
  3. A button to download the MP3 file of the song
  4. A playlist in the bottom-right corner where a user can:
     1. View their playlist
